<heritage>Peter's paintings depict farm and rural life from the 1950s to the present day,
as he has been painting for forty years. Probably the most unusual factor in
his artwork is the fact that he includes almost all facets of daily life, nothing
escapes his brush, motorcycles, hot air balloons aircraft, bicycles cars, trucks,
machinery, steam engines, emus etc etc...
