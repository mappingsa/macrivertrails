Mookerawa Waters is also
part of the Lake Burrendong
State Park but it is
approximately 15kms to the
south. Park facilities include
a kiosk, picnic areas, more
than 200 camping areas (no
powered sites available), boat ramps and barbecue facilities.
Mookerawa Waters Park is great for fishing, swimming,
skiing and boating. For the avid bushwalker there are many
walks available from easy to the more difficult. There’s even
a simple golf course.
