<riverbedz>The Boat House has two loft bedrooms &#45; both with views over
the estate and Macquarie River, queen beds and quality linen,
a luxurious bathroom upstairs with 2&#45;person Balinese stone
bath and a second powder room downstairs, a self&#45;contained
kitchen with quality fittings including dishwasher and fridge,
and a huge family area with large screen TV, dining room table
and comfortable lounges. 
<br>Located within 5 minutes of the
Dubbo CBD so access to the cityâ€™s restaurants, pubs,
attractions and corporate offices is convenient but far
enough away that you can experience
the tranquillity and privacy that the Boat House Villa has to offer.
