<riverbedz>Willie Retreat offers a range of accommodation options &#45; camping, on&#45;site
vans, powered and unpowered van sites, and the Retreat, which is the old
shearers quarters. It is also in the heart of Macquarie marsh wetlands &#45; when
they have water. Check first to avoid disappointment. <br>There is no after hours
access, and after rain access may be difficult, so be certain to book ahead.
