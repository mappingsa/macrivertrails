<education>The Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve and State
Conservation Area are managed by the NSW National Parks
and Wildlife Service. The nature reserve is separated into
two areas, the north and south marsh.
<br>The summer of 2010&#45;11 saw the largest flood in the
Macquarie Marshes for 10 years and resulted in the best
waterbird breeding event for 10 years with more than
70,000 Ibis and 40,000 Egrets, Cormorants, Darter, and
Night herons successfully breeding in the marshes.
<br>The Macquarie Marshes are a dynamic system,
experiencing wet and dry cycles, each equally interesting
in their own way. 
<br>There are a number of ways you can
experience the Macquarie Marshes. A simple drive along
Gibsonâ€™s Way is a good way to start and for many people
provides a good introduction to the Macquarie Marshes.
There is an Observation Platform along Gibson Way near
the Terrigal Creek.
<br>The Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve is surrounded by
private land and as such, is not generally accessible to the
public. However, a NPWS Discovery Weekend is held once a
year where NPWS staff and local NPWS Discovery Rangers
take members of the public on guided walks and tours.
This is usually held on the Labour Day long weekend in
October of each year and is subject to weather conditions.
NPWS Discovery walks and tours can also be organised at
other times of the year.
