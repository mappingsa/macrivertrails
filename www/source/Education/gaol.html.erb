<education>The Old Dubbo Gaol was a courthouse lockup in 1847, was proclaimed an official Gaol in 1859. It closed operations as a penal institution in 1966.
             <br>Officially re&#45;opened as a tourist attraction in 1974, the Old Dubbo Gaol is now fully restored and is home to a large display of animatronic models 
              and holographic displays which provide a realistic and fascinating insight into a bygone era of barbaric prison life.
