<education>Floating classroom can only take place in Dubbo. These include a 60&#45;90 minute guided cruise on the Macquarie River. A teacher is provided and the class activities can be structured to suit curriculum requirements or age groups.

<br>Alternatively, there is a land&#45;based option &#45; the Outdoor classroom &#45; which uses 10 portable A&#45;frames that can be positioned along a river trail and which use yes&#47;no type questions to quiz students about their knowledge of river health, biodiversity and climate change issues.

<br>Cost is negotiated depending on the group size (maximum is 20 students due to the size of the boat) and duration of class. In general cost is $15&#45;20&#47;person&#47;session.
