<education>Right in the heart of Wellington there are several places with blue 'Platypus country' signs marking locations where you might just see one of these elusive creatures.
<br><strong>Where to look&#58;</strong><br>
One spot is along the Bell River behind the parklands where you will also find the Visitors Information Centre in the centre of town. There's a suspension bridge for walkers. 
Further downstream, the Bell River joins the Macquarie at John Oxley Park &#40;where there is also a boat ramp&#41;. This is another spot where platypus have been seen.
            Upstream, if you stay at either the Bridge Motel or Riverside Caravan Park &#40;see details under the River Trail&#41; right on the river, you may see platypus there also. 
            Remember, the best times for platypus spotting are around dawn and dusk and you'll need to sit quietly.
