<art>Be entranced by the raw beauty of this unique visual art spectacle.
<br>The Wellington Gateway Sculpture is an interpretation of the
identity and spirit of Wellington and its people.
The main sculpture which comprises of the tripod and wind
chimes is actually constructed from a significant event in
Wellingtonâ€™s history &#45; The Old Wellington Bridge, which fell down in 1989. 
<br>Explore the hidden meanings instilled in each
single element, and marvel at the mysterious pulling power
which takes on totally different moods at different times of
the day.
