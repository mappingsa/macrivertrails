Burrendong State Park but it is approximately
15kms to the south. Park facilities include a kiosk,
picnic areas, more than 200 camping areas (no powered sites available), boat

swimming, skiing and boating. For the avid bushwalker there are many walks
available from easy to the more difficult. Thereâ€™s even a simple golf course.
