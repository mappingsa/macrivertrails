<bird>A great area for birding between Dubbo and Wellington, with areas of remnant woodlands
amongst agricultural lands. Great woodland and riparian birds like Diamond Firetails, Little Eagle, Speckled Warbler and many others have been seen in this area.

<br>One route through the area is described below
and in the map. The approximate driving
distance is 100km round trip from the Newell
Highway&#47;Obley Road intersection (the turn&#45;off
to Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo). The
distances below refer to the approximate road
distance from this intersection near the Zoo.

<br>Site 1 &#45; 4km &#45; Cumboogle Landcare
Reserve, opposite the Morris Park Race track.
Drive up the small road and park beside it.
Climb through the fence. This is a mixed box
woodland. Red&#45;capped Robins have been
seen here.

<br>Site 2 &#45; 8km &#45; the Cumboogle Fire Brigade
Shed. This small patch of woodland has had
Varied Sittellas and Superb Fairy wrens.
10km &#45; Turn left into Benolong Road.

<br>Site 3 &#45; 21km &#45; go left at the Benolong
Road T&#45;intersection, sign indicating towards
Dubbo. Stop on the old bridge over the Little
River, if no traffic and check out the water, if
any, for ducks and herons.

<br>Site 4 &#45; approximately 29km on your left
will be Peach Trees Reserve on the Macquarie
River. Dollarbirds and Sacred and Azure
Kingfishers could be seen here. A good
morning tea or lunchtime stop.

<br>Site 5 &#45; back on the road again, at the
T&#45;intersection just past Peach Trees (40km) turn
left towards Ponto and Geurie. Over the other
side of the old bridge on the Macquarie River, is
a large area to stop and have a wander through
Scabbing Flat Reserve.

<br>From here, either continue on to Geurie
Cemetery and Bald Hills Nature Reserve
(see elsewhere in this guide), both great for
birds, or turn around and head south towards
Arthurville.

<br>31km &#45; the River Road goes off to the east
(left) at this intersection. This heads down to
the Macquarie River after approximately 1km. If
you continue along this road you will eventually
get to Wellington via Mt Arthur Reserve (see
elsewhere in this guide).

<br>Otherwise continue south along the Geurie&#45;
Arthurville road towards Arthurville keeping
an eye out for Australian Pipits and other grass
birds. Continue on, crossing the old railway line
with Bushrangers Hill on your left. There are
some areas of nice woodlands along this section
(Site 6) and also two dams, one quite large
which always has a large number of water birds
including Yellow&#45;billed Spoonbills.

<br>Site 7 &#45; 45km &#45; continue straight ahead
through this four&#45;way intersection into Little
River Road, following it to cross a low&#45;level
bridge over the Little River again. Stop here for
a wander.

<br>Continue on this road as it turns right
(north) and becomes the Nubingerie Road. The
road climbs showing good views to the west
and north. When you reach the top of the hill
(Nubingerie Road&#47;Eulandool Road) you can
either turn left to head back to Obley Road,
or turn right and continue to Benolong Road,
where you turn left back towards Dubbo.
