<strong>DIRECTIONS:</strong>
Take the Narromine road from Dubbo (Mitchell
Highway) for approximately 12-13 kms (from
the 110km/hr sign leaving Dubbo) and turn right
onto a gravel road just after the Brummagen
Creek bridge. There is no signpost to the reserve.
Look for a property entrance 'Glen Ayr' and a
white letter box No. 2696 just as you turn off
the highway. Then proceed for approximately
1 km off the highway to the reserve along a
narrowing gravel road. From Narromine, take
the Dubbo road for approximately 10 kms and
turn left just before the Brummagen Creek
bridge - see landmarks to look for, described
previously.</p>

• Fishing is an allowed recreational activity on TSRs.

departure.
• Beware of stock on reserves – stock have right of way.

<p><strong>OTHER INFORMATION:</strong> As the photos show the river here is quite rocky
which makes navigating upstream in a boat
challenging. There are deep water areas here
where fish hang out.</p>
