<strong>DIRECTIONS:</strong>
If coming from the Wellington, Geurie direction
along the Mitchell Highway turn left at the
lights just before the L H Ford Bridge and then
take the first right into Bligh Street. Follow this
road a short distance until it veers to the right,
where you take the left hand turn and follow
this road to Sandy Beach. Otherwise, if youâ€™re
in the main shopping area, turnoff Macquarie
Street toward the river, and then follow Bligh
Street under the L H Ford bridge until you see
Sandy Beach Road on your right.</p>
