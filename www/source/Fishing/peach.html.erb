<strong>DIRECTIONS:</strong>
Turnoff the Mitchell Highway at the Mitchell
Inn Hotel in Geurie and follow this road
toward Ponto. You’ll cross the Macquarie River
a few kilometres later (this is Scabbing Flat
Falls Reserve - see previous entry). Take the
Terrabella Road turnoff and Peach Tree Reserve
is about 2 km from the turnoff on the right hand
side. There are two turn-offs. When we visited
the second one had just been graded!</p>

<p><strong>OTHER INFORMATION:</strong> Very popular with the locals for Easter and
other holiday periods. The reserve has a great
beach facing a short, riffle run. Away from this
the fishing is generally good, downstream
especially.</p>
