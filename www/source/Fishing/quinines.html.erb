<strong>DIRECTIONS:</strong>
This Travelling Stock Route (TSR) is not
signposted. From Warren take the Carinda
Road, past the showground/racecourse.
Approximately 6 kms from the centre of town
there is a bend and dip in the road with a dirt
track off to the right. Keep to the right where
there is an option. Follow along the track to the
river, approximately 500 metres. The track takes
you up and along a fence on the right hand side
and a tight left bend brings you to the top of
the bank.</p>
