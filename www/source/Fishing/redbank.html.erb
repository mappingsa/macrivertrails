<strong>DIRECTIONS:</strong>
Take the Newel Highway toward Gilgandra
and a few kilometres from Dubbo, as you pass
through Brocklehurst, there is a turn to the
left into Burraway road to Terramungamine
Reserve. The gate into Redbank Reserve
is your left about 4 or so kilometres past
Terramungamine Reserve. Overall this is less
than 10kms from the highway turnoff. Don’t
confuse the Reserve with the entrance to the
property Redbank which is few hundred metres
before it. Please remember to close the gate to
the Reserve.</p>
