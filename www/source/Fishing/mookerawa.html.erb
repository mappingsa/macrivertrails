            <strong>DIRECTIONS:</strong>
             This river park is in the heart of Wellington,
where the Bell River joins the Macquarie. If
coming from the Molong-Orange direction
follow the Mitchell Highway through town
toward Dubbo, but turn left into Gobolion Street
just before the bridge crosses the Macquarie
River. Follow this down until you go over the
low-level bridge and the Park is on your left.
From Dubbo direction - cross the main bridge
and turn immediately right into Gobolion Street
- then proceed to the low-level bridge etc.</p>
