<cycle >Warren has three cycling and walking tracks
- all of which will let you see other attractions
as well. But, this is &lsquo;plains country&rsquo;, so don&rsquo;t
expect too many hills&#33;</cycle>

  <strong>LOCATION:</strong>
   One track starts at the Tiger
Bay wetland - the Beemunnel trail - and
it runs for about 4 kms, out and back. The
second - the Rotary Centennial trail - runs out to the Warren Weir Reserve
on the upstream side of town. Itâ€™s about 10 kms out and back. The third - the
Laurie Elder Walk - runs out of town past the Golf Club to the level crossing on
Oxley Highway. All three give you a safe and leisurely way to see some of the
countryside and are great for the joggers too.</p>
