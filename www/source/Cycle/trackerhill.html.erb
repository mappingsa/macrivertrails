<cycle>Cycling and walking trail which forms river-based loops, a 13km urban loop from
Serisier Bridge to the Tamworth Street footbridge and return, and a longer loop
from the Tamworth Street footbridge past the Taronga Western Plains Zoo to
Dundullimal Reserve, crossing the river again there to return to Tamworth Street
via Macquarie Street. Provides great access to swimming and fishing locations.
